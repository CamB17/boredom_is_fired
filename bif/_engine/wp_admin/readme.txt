php files will be included everywhere
js/css files will only be loaded inside of the admin panel

eventually, id like to utilize a system where we can designate where these files should be loaded using the file name. ex:

filename.scss - would only load in the admin panel
filename.loggedin.scss - would load everywhere but only if logged in
